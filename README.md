If you are interested in contributing to this project please let me know.  I can be reached at lloyd.benson@gmail.com.  This project is a large undertaking so if you have specific areas you may think you can help out with, I'd certainly appreciate it.

Big areas where help can be done currently

1.  Help around users and authentication / authorization (angler)
2.  FE functionality improvements (gills)
3.  Notification System (just email is sufficient for now) - (brag)
4.  Statistics Engine (fillet)

Really there are tons of things that can be done so if you are interested in a continuous integration solution based on hapijs or are just wanting to learn more about hapijs and want some mentoring this may be the project for you.
